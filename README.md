Sometimes the futile things are always the most fascinating. 
Today I present the realisation of this self-balancing cube, nemed KinetiCube. 
An hypnotic cube that concentrates several scientific disciplines within it: Physics, mechanics, electronics and mathematics. 
As in an orchestra all working together in concert to make this cube stand upright.
Despite its simplicity, numerous operations and calculations are carried out in order to establish the right forces to be deployed. 
A beauty to look at and why not an opportunity to learn a few things from many angles. Sometimes even a simple game can become important for our growth. 
An open source project, which was, however, complex to realise and calibrate, so I put my own spin on it to make it feasible for everyone.

In addition I also made for a friend, the magician HYDE a version resembling a rubik's cube.
In this version, a number of improvements have been made to make it even simpler and aesthetically beautiful
